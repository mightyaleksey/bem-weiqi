## Weiqi
Hello

This is my small Weiqi (Go game) project. Currently I have small implementation BEM blocks, which are responsible for displaying the game board itself.

### About the game
* [Sensei's Library](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go)
* [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))

### Dependencies
* `node.js`
* `enb`
* `bem-core`

### Installation
Make sure you have installed `node.js`. Run in the repository folder:
```
make install
```
That will download necessary `npm` modules and `bower` components.

### Launch
```
make build run
```
